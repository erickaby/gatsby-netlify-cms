description: "> The point is... to live one's life in the full complexity of
  what one is, which is something much darker, more contradictory, more of a
  maelstrom of impulses and passions, of cruelty, ecstacy, and madness, than is
  apparent to the civilized being who glides on the surface and fits smoothly
  into the world."
